## Why Gerd?

More often starting a new project is a hustle, having to configure everything from scratch, and manually set the necessary parts up.
This is where gerd comes in to reduce the initial friction.

Gerd CLI help you quickly spawn up a fully configured project with few commands, we even have commands to add additional setups as
you move ahead with your project.

## Overview

The CLI has two main components, which are:

- Core commands [Core]
- Sub commands [Sub-core]

### Core commands

These are global commands.

Example: The `create` command is a global command can be used to scaffold a new project of any framework of your choice.

### Sub commands

These are commands specific to the various frameworks you can scaffold. To easify your workflow these have been backed in to provide
you with additional commands to add setups to your scaffolded project as you move along.

Example: If you scaffold a Next JS project with Gerd CLI, then you have access to the `next` sub commands to add further setups, such
as **"routes"** or **"auth"** to your project as you move along.

## Contribution

You can follow the following steps after you clone the repository to get started

- `cd cli`: change directory into the cli folder

- `deno task new`: follow the propmt to add in a new framework, this gives you a predefined structured folder
